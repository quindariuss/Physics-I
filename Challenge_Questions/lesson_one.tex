\section*{Instruction}
For this challenge question, we want you to provide your own answer to a Fermi estimation. Choose one of the following questions and upload your response into the Assignments folder. The ungraded estimation tutorial in Achieve may be helpful for this assignment.

\subsection*{Estimate the number of steps you take during a normal day on your college campus.}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 3 Classes
	\item 1 Lunch Break 
	\item 2 Trips to Vehicle
\end{enumerate}
\begin{quote}
	Assume 10 mins for a relaxed stroll between events. 
\end{quote}
\begin{gather}
	Minutes_{total} = (3_{Classes}+1_{Lunch Break}+ 2_{Trips to Vehicle}) * 10, \label{x1}\\
	60_{minutes} = 3600_{seconds}, \label{x2}\\
	1 second = 1 step, \label{x3}\\
	College Day_{steps_ = 3600 \label{x4}
\end{gather}
\subsection{Estimate}
I estimate on an average day with 3 classes, 1 Lunch Break, and 2 trips to get to and fro the vechicle a student will walk around 3600 steps a day. 
\emph
We expect you to state all assumptions and estimations needed to determine your final answer. Also, this is your estimate, not a 'correct' or measured answer. So don't just tell me what your Fitbit read at the end of the day for Choice 1. That is not the point (and I would only give you 1/5 if you did that).
