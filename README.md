### Course Description

Principles of Physics I and Laboratory is a 4 semester credit hour calculus-based introductory course which will include material from mechanics and waves. This course has a laboratory component that requires the purchase or acquisition of a limited amount of materials and equipment to complete the activities. Students enrolling in eCore lab science courses are advised to consult their transferring institution concerning the transferability of course credits.

### Goals

1. [ ] Understand and apply the laws and concepts associated with physics by solving word problems.
2. [ ] Perform simple laboratories and reach appropriate conclusions
3. [ ] Represent data graphically by hand and computer.
