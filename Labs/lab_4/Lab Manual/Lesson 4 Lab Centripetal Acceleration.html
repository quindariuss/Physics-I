<h1>Lesson 4 Lab: Centripetal Acceleration</h1>
</content></header>
<section image="" fit="" shape=""><heading>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
</heading><content>
<p style="text-align: left;">Velocity is a vector with both magnitude and direction. Since acceleration is a measure of a change in velocity over time, then either the magnitude of a velocity vector is changing, or the direction, or both. If magnitude is changing only, then the motion occurs in one dimension and the principles of algebra can be applied to the equations of motion. But what should be the acceleration if the direction of velocity is changing while the object maintains a constant speed?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This activity imagines a point-like object traveling at a constant speed clockwise around a circular path. It can be shown from calculus that the velocity vector for an object moving along a curved arc is always tangent to its path. It can also be shown from Euclidian geometry that a tangent to a circle is perpendicular to its radius. Graphical analysis will be used to estimate the acceleration of the object at the identified point under different sets of parameters, and the results will be compared to each other to derive the mathematical form of the resulting acceleration. A graphical vector analysis of velocity vectors will allow us to deduce both the direction of the acceleration and the mathematical relationship between the acceleration, speed of the moving object and the radius of the circular path.</p>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
</heading> <content>
<p style="text-align: left;">Download and print two copies of the large circular arc and one copy of the small circular arc. The center of each arc is identified as a point on the paper. The figures were created with the radius of the larger circle equal to 9.0 cm and 4.5 cm for the smaller circle, but it is possible that your numerical values may be slightly different from these as a result of downloading and printing. Even so, the two radii should still have a 2:1 ratio.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Starting with one of the large arcs, mark a point on the curve vertically above the center of the circle. We will analyze the acceleration of an object at this point of its motion.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Imagine the initial time, t<sub>i</sub>, starting at a 20-degree angle before the point of interest and the final time, t<sub>f</sub>, ending at a 20-degree angle after the point of interest. If the change in time &Delta;t = t<sub>f</sub> - t<sub>i</sub>, then by symmetry it takes a time of &Delta;t/2 to reach the point from the initial location and &Delta;t/2 to continue to the final location. Therefore, by symmetry the acceleration about at the point of interest will be</p>
<p align="center"><math title=""  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mstyle><mi>a</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">&#x0394;<!-- Δ --></mi><mi>v</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">&#x0394;<!-- Δ --></mi><mi>t</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mi>f</mi></mrow></msub><mo>&#x2212;<!-- − --></mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">&#x0394;<!-- Δ --></mi><mi>t</mi></mrow></mfrac></mstyle><annotation encoding="latex">{"version":"1.1","math":"a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{(v_{f}-v_{i}  )}{\Delta t} "}</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The numerical value of &Delta;t is arbitrary, and we can choose to use a time scale such that it is equal to 1.0. In any case, no matter what its value, the key points are that the magnitude of the acceleration vector is proportional to the &Delta;v vector, and that the directions of the acceleration and &Delta;v vectors are the same.</p>
<subsection>
<h3>Case 1: Large Circle, Base Speed</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Draw the radius from the center of the circle to the point on the left (time t<sub>i</sub>) 20 degrees before the point of interest. Use a protractor to identify the perpendicular to the radius through that point and draw an arrow 3.0 cm long with its tail at the mark and pointing to the right. Include an arrow head at its tip. Repeat these steps at the mark 20 degrees to the right of the point of interest, (time t<sub>f</sub>).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Subtract the initial velocity vector from the final velocity vector. Do this by marking an angle of 40 degrees (the full change in angle) at the tail of the final velocity vector and above it. Draw a vector 3.0 cm long so that the tails touch. Since this new vector is parallel to and the same length as v<sub>i</sub>, the result is the graphical subtraction, v<sub>f</sub> - v<sub>i</sub> = &Delta;v if the &Delta;v vector is drawn starting at the tip of the vector v<sub>i</sub> and ending at the tip of vector v<sub>f</sub>. Measure and record the length of the change in velocity vector, &Delta;v, in the data table on the Report Sheet.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A slide show documenting each step of this process can be seen below.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQdhm5P8wBCICTQ5-QSlEJ5u8h5dZPXYI5uy3h8pCPOMHVZySykuCsrc3GyeQ3DVWtAIbLaombwIg-y/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=60000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p>
</subsection> <subsection>
<h3>Case 2: Large Circle, Twice the Speed</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now consider an object moving twice as fast as the first case. The length of the arrow will be twice as long, but it will also travel twice as far in the same time, &Delta;t. Therefore, repeat these steps on the second large circular arc, only now draw arrows that are 6.0 cm long and perpendicular to the radius but at a 40-degree angle on either side of the point of interest.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Measure and record the length of the change in velocity vector, &Delta;v, in the data table on the Report Sheet.</p>
</subsection> <subsection>
<h3>Case 3: Small Circle, Base Speed</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, consider an object moving at the original speed (the 3.0 cm arrow) but along a circular path half the radius of the first case. Because the linear speed is measured as the distance traveled along the arc over the time, the correct location on the circular path for the same change in time &Delta;t as in the first case must begin and end 40-degrees before and past the point of interest, as with Case 2. Therefore, draw 3.0 cm arrows at +/- 40-degree angles and subtract the two vectors graphically as before. Measure and record the length of the change in velocity vector, &Delta;v, in the data table on the Report Sheet.</p>

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
</heading> <content>
<p style="text-align: left;">The goal of this activity is to determine the direction of the acceleration and the functional relationship between the magnitudes of the speed of the moving object, the radius of the circular path, and the resulting acceleration.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The direction of the acceleration can be deduced by examining the &Delta;v vectors, since they are proportional to the acceleration vector and acting in the same direction. We would not expect the direction of the acceleration at the point of interest to change with just a change in magnitude of the speed or radius; therefore; we would assume the directions of all three &Delta;v vectors will be the same.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The functional relationship between the three quantities could be almost anything -- exponential, trigonometric -- but we have strong reason to believe it is probably algebraic. The following data table summarizes the characteristics of four common algebraic relationships that are frequently encountered in the natural sciences: proportional; inverse proportional; square; and inverse square.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>

</tbody>

<content>
<p style="text-align: left;">One common way to identify the correct relationship is to change one variable by a simple whole number ratio: for example, to double it. This is what we did in these three Cases. For Case 2, we doubled the speed of Case 1 while maintaining a constant radius; for Case 3, we maintained a constant speed as Case 1 but cut the radius in half.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Calculate the ratios &Delta;v<sub>2</sub>/&Delta;v<sub>1</sub> and &Delta;v<sub>3</sub>/&Delta;v1 using the measured lengths of the &Delta;v vectors and record the values on the Report Sheet to the closest tenth. We will use these ratios to determine the most likely algebraic relationships between the variables.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For example, if the ratio &Delta;v<sub>2</sub>/&Delta;v<sub>1</sub> is closest to 2.0, that would suggest a proportional relationship between a and v; if it is closer to 4.0, that would suggest a square relationship. On the other hand, if &Delta;v<sub>2</sub>/&Delta;v<sub>1</sub> is close to 0.5, the relationship would be inverse, or inverse square if close to 0.25.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
</heading> <content>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>1.</strong> Based on the &Delta;v vectors from the three Cases, what appears to be the direction of the acceleration of the object with respect to the point of interest, which was vertically above the center of the circular path? (i.e.: up, down, to the right, to the left, etc.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2.</strong> Given that the point of interest was arbitrarily chosen, what appears to be the direction <em>in general</em> of this type of acceleration? (Hint: the answer is in the name of this activity.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>3.</strong> Given the numerical value of the ratio &Delta;v<sub>2</sub>/&Delta;v<sub>1</sub> for Cases 1 and 2, what appears to be the mostly likely algebraic relationship between the acceleration and constant speed for an object traveling in a circular path?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>4.</strong> Given the numerical value of the ratio &Delta;v<sub>3</sub>/&Delta;v<sub>1</sub> for Cases 1 and 3, what appears to be the mostly likely algebraic relationship between the acceleration and radius of the circle for an object traveling in a circular path?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>5.</strong> Combine the last two responses into a single relationship for acceleration, speed and radius for an object traveling at a constant speed on a circular path.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">(Note that this model only allows us to predict the functional relationship between acceleration, speed and radius. We cannot write an <em>equation</em> for centripetal acceleration, only a proportionality.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A proportionality becomes an equation with the addition of a proportionality constant. The value of the constant depends on the measured values of the variables under experimental conditions and the choice of units. However, if speed, radius and acceleration are measured in consistent SI units, the proportionality constant for the centripetal acceleration is "1".)</p>
