<h1>Lesson 9 Lab: Conservation of Energy</h1>
</content></header>
<section image="" fit="" shape=""><heading>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
</heading> <content>
<p style="text-align: left;">In any interaction, the sum of all the energies of the objects in a system plus any work done by outside forces must equal the sum of all the final energies. This experiment will test the principle for three different energy conversions between gravitational potential energy, elastic potential energy, kinetic energy and work.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The presentation of all energy conversions will follow the same format: Each trial begins with a diagram showing the 'before' and 'after' conditions with all the known initial parameters of the interaction (mass, spring constant, etc.) included in the diagram. The diagram is followed by the 'master equation' for energy conservation, and then the energies involved in that interaction. The third line replaces the type of energy with the method of calculation, followed by a series of algebraic steps, resulting in a report of the unknown quantity with an appropriate number of significant figures and a unit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Each investigation concludes with a comparison of the calculated quantity to its experimentally-measured value: a speed, force, or distance.</p>
<subsection>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Suppose we wanted to test the conversion of kinetic energy to frictional work. The system consists of a marble rolling across a smooth floor and then onto a piece of carpet, where it slows to a stop due to frictional forces.</p>

<h2>Data Collection and Analysis</h2>
</heading> <content> <subsection>
<h3>Case 1: Gravitational Potential Energy to Kinetic Energy</h3>
<p>This system consists of a marble rolling down a ramp and across a level surface. Assume the mass of the marble is 5.0 g.</p>
<p>Place a marble near the top of a ramp and measure the vertical distance from the base of the ramp to the marble. Let g = 10 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Use conservation of energy to solve for the speed of the marble at the bottom of the ramp.</p>
<accordion><panel topic="Case 1 Example">
<p align="center"><iframe id="kaltura_player_1605813145" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/2248021/sp/224802100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/44828561/partner_id/2248021?iframeembed=true&amp;playerId=kaltura_player_1605813145&amp;entry_id=1_c0nni6ok" width="640" height="360" allowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay *; fullscreen *; encrypted-media *" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
</panel></accordion>
<p>Use the same method as in the <em>Uniform and Accelerated Motion</em> experiment to determine the average speed of the marble as it rolls across the level surface at the base of the ramp (a measured horizontal distance divided by the time interval it takes to roll that distance).</p>
<p>Compare the predicted value of the marble's speed from energy conservation principles to the experimentally measured value.</p>

<h3>Case 2: Elastic Potential Energy to Work</h3>
<p>This system consists of a book attached to a stretched rubber band that slides across a level surface and comes to rest after the book is let go.</p>
<accordion><panel topic="Case 2 Example">
<p align="center"><iframe id="kaltura_player_1605819968" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/2248021/sp/224802100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/44828561/partner_id/2248021?iframeembed=true&amp;playerId=kaltura_player_1605819968&amp;entry_id=1_dggxs5it" width="640" height="360" allowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay *; fullscreen *; encrypted-media *" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
</panel></accordion>
<p>Loop two rubber bands together to form a longer one with a relatively low Hooke's law constant. Use the procedure from the <em>Hooke's Law</em> experiment to calculate its value.</p>
<accordion><panel topic="Hooke's Law Constant Review">
<p align="center"><iframe id="kaltura_player_1605820098" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/2248021/sp/224802100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/44828561/partner_id/2248021?iframeembed=true&amp;playerId=kaltura_player_1605820098&amp;entry_id=1_2hs1tddm" width="640" height="360" allowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay *; fullscreen *; encrypted-media *" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
</panel></accordion>
<p style="text-align: left;">Attach the rubber band to the book with a paper clip and stretch it a measured distance while holding the book in place. Let go of the book and measure the distance the object slides from its initial position to its final position at rest.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If the rubber band is even slightly stretched, it still has some elastic potential energy in it which must be accounted for in the calculations. It is easier just to repeat the trial with a longer stretching distance so that the rubber band is completely loose after the interaction.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Use conservation of energy to solve for the average frictional force acting between the book and the surface.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Measure the average kinetic frictional force by pulling the book at a constant speed with a spring scale.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Compare the predicted value of the average frictional force from energy conservation principles to the experimentally measured value.</p>
</subsection> <subsection>
<h3>Case 3: Gravitational Potential Energy to Elastic Potential Energy</h3>
<p>This system consists of an object such as a book or can of soda hanging from a slack rubber band. The object is let go and it drops to a lowest point, where it is momentarily at rest before rebounding, like a person attached to a bungee cord. Use conservation of energy to solve for the greatest stretching distance of the rubber band when the object is at its lowest point before rebounding.</p>
<accordion><panel topic="Case 3 Example">
<p align="center"><iframe id="kaltura_player_1605820193" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/2248021/sp/224802100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/44828561/partner_id/2248021?iframeembed=true&amp;playerId=kaltura_player_1605820193&amp;entry_id=1_e8wvnhew" width="640" height="360" allowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay *; fullscreen *; encrypted-media *" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
</panel></accordion>
<p style="text-align: left;">For this experiment, the vertical height for the calculation of gravitational potential energy, h, is equal to the extension of the rubber band, x. The Hooke's law constant for the rubber band from the last energy conversion has already been calculated. The weight of the object (F<sub>g</sub> = mg) can be found by hanging it, at rest, from a spring scale.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After the stretching distance has been predicted, attach a paperclip to the rubber band's loop and hook it to the book or the ring tab of a can of soda. Set a meter stick vertically behind the object so that its initial location is the origin. Drop the book and note the lowest point reached before rebounding. Since that happens quickly, it may be helpful to do this a few times and take an average value.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Compare the predicted value of the change in vertical height from energy conservation principles to the experimentally measured value.</p>
