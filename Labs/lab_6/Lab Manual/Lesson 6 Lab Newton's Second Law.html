<h1>Lesson 6 Lab: Newton's Second Law</h1>
</content></header>
<section image="" fit="" shape=""><heading>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
</heading> <content>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sir Isaac Newton's second law of motion states that the acceleration of an object is proportional to the applied force and inversely proportional to its mass. These two claims can be combined into a single mathematical expression:</p>
<p align="center"><math title=""  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mstyle><msub><mi>F</mi><mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mi>n</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow></msub><mo>&#x221D;<!-- ∝ --></mo><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi></mstyle><annotation encoding="latex">{"version":"1.1","math":"F_{net} \propto ma"}</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>
<p>The proportionality can be replaced by an equal sign with the addition of a proportionality constant:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><math title=""  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mstyle><msub><mi>F</mi><mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mi>n</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mi>k</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi></mstyle><annotation encoding="latex">{"version":"1.1","math":"F_{net} = kma"}</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>
<p>If mass is measured in kg, acceleration in m/s<sup>2</sup>, and force in Newtons (1 N = 1 kg-m/s<sup>2</sup>) then the proportionality constant k = 1 and</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><math title=""  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mstyle><msub><mi>F</mi><mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mi>n</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi></mstyle><annotation encoding="latex">{"version":"1.1","math":"F_{net} = ma"}</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since the equation has three variables, it is necessary to hold one constant while investigating the relationship between the other two. In the first part of this experiment, the total accelerating mass is held constant and the relationship between acceleration and applied force is explored. In the second part, the same force is applied to systems of differing mass and the acceleration of each system is measured.</p>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
</heading> <content> <subsection>
<h3>Constant Mass</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">A Vernier motion detector was used to measure the position and velocity of a Pasco car moving on a horizontal track. One end of a string was attached to the front of the cart and the other end was attached to a 50-gram weight hanger suspended from a pulley.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The mass of the car was 250 grams. In addition to the car itself, a 250-g mass and three slotted weights ‐ two 20-g masses and a 10-g mass ‐ were also placed on the car. Therefore, a total of 600 grams was accelerated while the weight was falling.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When the weight hanger was released, the constant gravitational force of the falling mass was transferred through the string as a constant tension pulling the car forward. Since the gravitational force is the product of mass and the gravitational constant, the applied force was 0.49 N. A motion detector was positioned behind the car and it began collecting data of velocity as a function of time a few moments before the weight hanger was released.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After the first run, the 10-g mass was transferred from the car to the weight hanger, resulting in 60 grams of hanging mass and a 0.59 N applied force. Because the 10-g mass was still being accelerated, whether on the car or on the weight hanger, the total accelerating mass was still 600 grams. This process was repeated in 10-gram increments by moving the 20-g and 10-g masses back and forth between the car and the weight hanger.</p>
</subsection> <subsection>
<h3>Constant Force</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">For the second part of the investigation, the 50-gram weight hanger pulled on the 250-gram car for the first trial. In the second trial, a 250-gram mass was added to the car but the constant applied force was still just the weight hanger (0.49 N). Two more 250-gram masses were added, one at a time, for trials three and four.</p>

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
</heading> <content> <subsection>
<h3>Constant Mass</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Start the Logger Pro<sup>TM</sup> software and open the file <em>50g.cmbl</em>. In order to watch the data collection happen in real time, it is necessary for the <em>50g.mov</em> file to be in the same directory on your computer as the *.<em>cmbl</em> file. However, it is not necessary for the movie to play in order to see the data being collected: you will still be able to complete the data analysis even if the movie is not functioning.</p>
<accordion><panel topic="Example">
<p align="center"><img src="First%20Trial.png" alt="Constant mass first trial" title="Constant mass first trial" style="max-width: 70%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" /></p>
<p align="center">Constant mass first trial.</p>
</panel></accordion>
<p style="text-align: left;">Choose Start on the Replay dialog box to play the movie and watch position vs. time and velocity vs. time data being collected. Select the velocity vs. time graph and highlight the straight-line portion of the graph in the middle of the curve. Choose the Linear Fit button from the top menu and record the slope of the line (the constant acceleration) in the data table on the Report Sheet for the 0.49 N applied force.</p>

<p align="center">Acceleration from the slope of the v(t) plot.</p>
</panel></accordion>
<p>Open the file, <em>60g.cmbl</em> and movie and repeat this process. Measure the constant accelerations for 70, 80, 90 and 100 grams of falling mass from the respective Logger Pro<sup>TM</sup> files.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Open a new file in Logger Pro<sup>TM</sup> to begin with a blank data table. Enter the data recorded for this Part on the Report Sheet with the acceleration recorded in the x-column and the applied force in the y-column. Plot acceleration on the x-axis in units of m/s<sup>2</sup> versus applied force on the y-axis in units of Newtons. Include (0,0) as a data point. Find the slope of straight line passing through the data and record the value on the Report Sheet. Note that the unit <em>N/m/s<sup>2</sup></em> is the same as <em>kg</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">(The data in the examples shown below are for a <em>different</em> system than the one represented by these trials.)</p>

<p align="center">Graph showing force as a function of acceleration.</p>
</panel></accordion>
<p>Save the file as <em>constant_mass.cmbl</em> and submit it with the Report Sheet. The plot should show proper graphing technique: a title for the graph, labeled axes, a solid point symbol, etc.</p>
</subsection> <subsection>
<h3>Constant Force</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Open the <em>250g.cmbl</em> and <em>250g.mov</em> files and repeat the procedure for the car being pulled by the 50-g mass. Include the 50-gram weight hanger as part of the total mass accelerated by the applied force for each trial. Record the constant acceleration from the slope of the line on the v vs. t plot in the first row of the data table on the Report Sheet. Measure the acceleration of the car for the other three trials: <em>500g.cmbl, 750g.cmbl,</em> and <em>1000g.cmbl</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Open a new file in Logger Pro<sup>TM</sup> to begin with a blank data table. Enter the total mass in units of kg in the x-column and the acceleration in m/s<sup>2</sup> in the y-column. Use the Calculated Column option from the Data menu to calculate the inverse mass for each trial in units of 1/kg.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Plot total mass on the x-axis vs. acceleration on the y-axis. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do not</span> draw a straight line through the data because it is not a proportional relationship, even though the four points plotted may appear to lie on a straight line.</p>

<p align="center">Graph showing acceleration as a function of mass.</p>
</panel></accordion>
<p style="text-align: left;">Use the Add Page... option to plot inverse mass on the x-axis versus acceleration on the y-axis. Note that the data appears to be a straight line passing through the origin. Find the slope of straight line and record the value on the Report Sheet. Note that the unit <em>m/s<sup>2</sup>/kg</em> is the same as <em>N</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Save the file as <em>constant_force.cmbl</em> and submit it with the Report Sheet. The plot should show proper graphing technique: a title for the graph, labeled axes, a solid point symbol, etc.</p>
